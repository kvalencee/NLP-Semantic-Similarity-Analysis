    "Este programa implementa diferentes algoritmos para identificar similitudes entre palabras, frases y documentos, utilizando tanto enfoques semánticos como sintácticos. Se analizan cinco documentos de Project Gutenberg mediante varias técnicas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Similitud de palabras con synsets**: Uso de las métricas de WordNet \"wup_similarity\" y \"path_similarity\" para encontrar términos similares.\n",
    "2. **Similitud de documentos con synsets**: Comparación de frases representativas mediante \"path_similarity\".\n",
    "3. **Similitud de palabras con embedding**: Utilización del modelo pre-entrenado GloVe para identificar términos similares mediante similitud de coseno.\n",
    "4. **Similitud de documentos con embedding**: Aplicación del modelo BERT para encontrar similitud entre documentos.\n",

      "then, butterflies are reduced from the rank of a sub-order, which they\r\n",
      "formerly held, and are now dovetailed into the various newer systems of\r\n",
      "arrangement between certain families of moths.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As regards British butterflies, however, it will be found that these\r\n",
      "may be known, as such, by their clubbed horns. Only the Burnets among\r\n",
      "British moths have horns in any way similar, and these are thickened\r\n",
      "gradually towards the extremity rather than clubbed. Day-flying moths,\r\n",
      "especially the bright-coloured ones, might be mistaken for butterflies\r\n",
      "by the uninitiated, but in all these the horns will be found not at all\r\n",
      "butterfly-like.\r\n",

      "Although varieties of the species will be referred to in the descriptive\r\n",
      "portion of the book, a few general remarks on variation in butterflies\r\n",
      "may here be made. All kinds are liable to vary in tint or in the\r\n",
      "markings, sometimes in both. Such variation, in the more or less\r\n",
      "constant species especially, is perhaps only trivial and therefore\r\n",
      "hardly attracts attention. In a good many kinds variation is often of a\r\n",
      "very pronounced character, and is then almost certain to obtain notice.\r\n",
      "Except in a few instances, where the aberration is of an unusual kind,\r\n",
      "it is possible to obtain all the intermediate stages, or gradations,\r\n",
      "between the ordinary form of a species and its most extreme variety. A\r\n",
      "series of such connecting links in the variation of a species is of\r\n",
      "greater interest, and higher educational value, than one in which the\r\n",
      "extremes alone have a place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In those kinds of butterflies that attain the perfect state twice in the\r\n",
      "year, the individuals composing the first flight are somewhat different\r\n",
      "in marking from those of the second flight. Such species as the large\r\n",
      "and small whites exhibit this kind of variation, which is termed\r\n",
      "seasonal dimorphism. The males of some species, as for example the\r\n",
      "Common Blue and the Orange-tip, differ from the females in colour; this\r\n",
      "is known as sexual dimorphism. The Silver-Washed Fritillary, which has\r\n",
      "two forms of the female, one brown like the male, the other green or\r\n",
      "greenish in colour, is a good example of dimorphism confined to one sex.\r\n",
      "Gynandrous specimens, sometimes called \"Hermaphrodites,\" are those which\r\n",
      "exhibit both male and female coloration, or other wing characters; when\r\n",
      "one side is entirely male and the other side entirely female, the\r\n",
      "gynandromorphism would be described as complete.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ornamentation on the under side of a butterfly differs from that of\r\n",
      "the upper side, and is found to assimilate or harmonize in a remarkable\r\n",
      "manner with the usual resting-place. It is therefore of service to the\r\n",
      "insect when settled with wings erect over the back, in the manner of all\r\n",
      "butterflies, except some few kinds of Skippers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The number of known species of butterflies throughout the world has been\r\n",
      "put at about thirteen thousand, and it has been suggested by Dr. Sharp\r\n",
      "that there may be nearly twice as many still awaiting discovery. Dr.\r\n",
      "Staudinger in his \"Catalog\" gives a list of over seven hundred kinds of\r\n",
      "butterflies as occurring in the whole of the Palæarctic Region. This\r\n",
      "zoological region embraces Europe, including the British Islands, Africa\r\n",
      "north of the Atlas range of mountains, and temperate Asia, including\r\n",
      "Japan. The entire number of species that can by any means be regarded as\r\n",
      "British does not exceed sixty-eight. Even this limited total comprises\r\n",
      "sundry migratory butterflies, such as the Clouded Yellows, the Painted\r\n",
      "Lady, the Red Admiral, the Camberwell Beauty, and the Milkweed\r\n",

      "visitors, the Long-tailed Blue and the Bath White. Again, the Large\r\n",
      "Copper is now extinct in England, and the Mazarine Blue does not seem to\r\n",
      "have been observed in any of its old haunts in the country for over\r\n",
      "forty years. The Black-veined White is also scarce and exceedingly\r\n",
      "local.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The majority of the remaining fifty-seven butterflies may be considered\r\n",
      "natives, and of these about half are so widely distributed that the\r\n",
      "young collector should, if fairly energetic, secure nearly all of them\r\n",
      "during his first campaign. The other species will have to be looked for\r\n",
      "in their special localities, but a few kinds are so strictly attached to\r\n",
      "particular spots, that a good deal of patience will have to be exercised\r\n",
      "before a chance may occur of obtaining them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few remarks may here be made in reference to the names and arrangement\r\n",
      "adopted in the present volume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As will be adverted to in the descriptive section, the English names of\r\n",
      "our butterflies have not always been quite the same as those now in\r\n",
      "general use. There has, however, been far less stability in scientific\r\n",
      "nomenclature, and very many changes in both generic and specific names\r\n",
      "have been made during the past twenty years, more especially perhaps\r\n",
      "within the last decade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Genera are now founded by some specialists on characters which formerly\r\n",
      "served to distinguish one species from another, whilst other authorities\r\n",
      "merge several genera in one upon certain details of structure that are\r\n",
      "common to them all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Patient research into the entomological antiquities has revealed much\r\n",
      "important material, some of which may furnish a new interpretation of\r\n",
      "the Linnean classification of Lepidoptera.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The discovery of the earliest Latin specific name bestowed upon an\r\n",
      "insect, is a labour which entails a large expenditure of time and\r\n",
      "requires fine judgment. Great credit is therefore due to those who\r\n",
      "undertake such investigations, the result of which may tend to the\r\n",
      "establishment of a fixed nomenclature in the, probably not remote,\r\n",
      "future, although it sadly hampers and perplexes students in the\r\n",
      "meanwhile.\r\n",

      "crocodile, a dogfish, a cuttlefish, and a spider afford well-known\r\n",

      "preserved for us, and William Harvey, the famous demonstrator of the\r\n",
      "mammalian blood circulation two thousand years later, agreed in\r\n",
      "regarding the pupa as a second egg. The egg laid by a butterfly had not,\r\n",

      "of a complex organism like the parent; only the imperfect larva could be\r\n",
      "produced from it. The larva was regarded as feeding voraciously for the\r\n",
      "purpose of acquiring a large store of nutritive material, after which it\r\n",
      "was believed to revert to the state of a second but far larger egg, the\r\n",
      "pupa, from which the winged insect could take origin. Others again,\r\n",
      "following de Réaumur (1734), have speculated whether the development of\r\n",
      "pupa within larva, and of winged insect within pupa might not be\r\n",
      "explained as abnormal births. But a comparison of the transformation of\r\n",
      "butterflies with simpler insect life-stories will convince the enquirer\r\n",
      "that no such heroic theories as these are necessary. It will be realised\r\n",
      "that even the most profound transformation among insects can be\r\n",
      "explained as a special case of growth.\n"

      "persons who frequent the public saloons one day, and are found on the\r\n",
      "next in the most obscure haunts, dressed as mendicants. Most of the\r\n",

      "other animal than that in which it was discovered. All helminthologists,\r\n",
      "with few exceptions, looked upon worms in the interior of the body as\r\n",
      "formed without parents in the same organs which they occupy. Worms\r\n",
      "which are parasites of fish, had been seen a long time before this in\r\n",

      "satisfy observers of the possibility of these creatures passing from\r\n",
      "one body to another; but all these experiments had only given a\r\n",

      "raised the cry of heresy, when Rudolphi spoke of the ligulæ of fishes\r\n",
      "which could continue to live in birds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a period nearer to our own times, our learned friend, Von Siebold,\r\n",
      "deservedly called the prince of helminthologists, was entirely of this\r\n",
      "opinion, and compared the cysticercus of the mouse with the tape-worm\r\n",
      "of the cat, considering this young worm as a wandering, sick, and\r\n",
      "dropsical being.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "that is to say, they have seen nematodes, the parasites of the lungs\r\n",
      "of the frog, always female or hermaphrodite, produce individuals of\r\n",
      "the two sexes which do not resemble their mother, and whose habitual\r\n",
      "abode is not in the lungs of the frog but in damp earth. In other\r\n",
      "words, let us imagine a mother, born a widow, who cannot exist without\r\n",
      "the assistance of others, producing boys and girls able to provide for\r\n",
      "themselves. The mother is parasitical and viviparous, her daughters\r\n",
      "are, during their whole life, free and oviparous.\r\n",
